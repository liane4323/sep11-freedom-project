## Content
In this entry:
1. Takeaways from giving my Expo elevator pitch
2. Takeaways from giving my in-class presentation

In this blog entry, I will be sharing the final steps that I went through when presenting my project. I will also be talking about the overall takeaways I have gained from this experience.

### In-class Presentation
I was one of the first students to present during our in-class presentations, just like last year. Even though I felt nervous at first, I was surprised by how comfortable I became in front of my classmates. We were all learning and growing together, and somewhere along the way, the stress started to fade. Presenting in class gave me valuable experience with public speaking and helped me understand what it truly feels like to share my hard work with others. One important takeaway was the importance of highlighting the process that led to my final product. Looking back, I realize that including more about my journey and growth would have made my presentation even stronger. Next time, I’ll be sure to focus on both the outcome and the steps that brought me there. I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’m excited to keep growing as a presenter and make my future presentations even more impactful.


### Expo elevator pitch

Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to attend the expo this year, so as an alternative, I presented my elevator pitch to family and friends many of whom had little to no knowledge of software engineering. Compared to last year’s elevator pitch, I noticed a huge difference in the way I carried myself. I felt more confident in what I had to present and less anxious about potential questions. Completing every stage of this year-long Freedom Project really helped me grow in multiple areas, especially in presenting. The in-class presentation gave me valuable practice speaking in front of a larger group, and because I was presenting to classmates, it felt less intimidating. That experience definitely helped me prepare for sharing my work with others outside of school. Overall, I see a big improvement in my expo skills, and I’m hopeful that I’ll continue to grow even more in the years to come.




## [EDP](https://hstatsep.github.io/students/#edp) (Engineering Design Process)
Since it is nearly the end of the year and the Freedom Project is done, I am on the final step of the EDP which is, **"communicate the results"**. I am practicing this step in thsi blog by communicating all that was completed. 


## Skills

Throughout this time period, I am proud to say that I have accomplished many skills. Those of which may include public speaking and accountability. 

### Public Speaking 
I developed my public speaking skills in several ways throughout this project. For example, the in-class presentations gave me a chance to practice speaking in front of an audience, and I think they went really well. Another opportunity came when I delivered my elevator pitch to both peers and family members. Through these two experiences, I was able to build confidence and improve how I present myself. Looking back, I’ve realized that the more I practice public speaking, the more comfortable and confident I become.


### Accountability

One way I practiced accountability was by creating the Google Slides for this presentation. I held myself responsible for completing it thoroughly and meeting the deadline. I’ve also practiced this skill in many other classes. For example, by making sure I complete my homework on time. Overall, I would say that I’ve demonstrated accountability numerous times, and I’m continuing to learn, step by step, how to become more independent and take full responsibility for my work.
