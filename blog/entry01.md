# Entry 1 ♡
##### 10/28/24

 In this blog, I will be going over my journey of choosing a topic and tinkering.

## Context

For this freedom project, I will create a Personality Quiz using the _Easy Toggle State_ tool and my previous knowledge on HTML, CSS, and JS. This quiz will include points that the user will keep track of. At the end of the quiz they will receive the personality trait results. Based on the points they received, the user will find their personality trait. Some concepts like Radio buttons and Dropdowns will be useful in order to complete this project.

### Choosing a Topic

The first plan that I had was this Personality Quiz, my backup plan was to create a memory game using jQuery. I chose the Personality Quiz because I genuinely believe that people should be aware of their Personality traits.

 I came up with serveral implications as to why my project would have a positive impact on society:

**Implications**

* _Global_
    * Big systems (i.e. education, healthcare, etc): Schools can use this app in order to test students to see their wellness levels. Staff can later on use the results to create positive learning environments that are fit for students.


* _Social_
    * Individual: This app can have positive effects on individuals. They are able to be more aware of their traits and learn more about themselves. It can improve self awareness, helping you understand yourself better in terms of knowing your strengths and weaknesses. People battling with extreme anxiety and stress can enable them to practice coping mechanisms according to their personality traits.

    * Relationships: A person’s personality shapes the relationships they have with others. Understanding others can maintain healthy relationships. It influences how a person connects and communicates. If you want to learn more about your partner, you can get to know more by using the Personality App.


* _Economic_
    * Jobs: After using the Personality App, choosing jobs would be like a breeze. Being aware of your personality trait would help you see your natural talents which could help you choose a job that is friendly to you. If a person is already employed, they can make their way up the chain of command and ensure success in the field. Improving communication style can help you build a stronger relationship with colleagues and professional interactions in the workplace.

    * Finance (personal/corporate): When you know your personality type, you can hold yourself accountable for financial decisions. It can help you with investing, spending, saving, and so much more. On a broader scale, you can improve widely into decision making in general and achieve your financial goals.


## Tinkering

Now that I figured out that I 100% wanted to go with this plan, I started my _tinkering process_. The first thing that I did was: Open up my IDE. I cd into my tools folder and use `touch` to create a tinkering file. After that I tried using pieces of code like

 ``` js
 <button
	type="button"
	class="example-checkbox"
	data-toggle-class="is-checked">
</button>
```

 to try and test out if this would do anything. I continued to test out pieces of code from the Easy Toggle State website. Before I continue tinkering I came up with another plan to be more _organized_. My plan is to create a demo website using these new concepts that I learnt. I started jotting down what I want my demo website to look like. 

 ## EDP (Engineering Design Process)

I am on stage 1 of the engineering design process which is **Define the Problem**.




 ## Skills

 I learnt 2 important skills of organization and decision making that I will use as takeaways


 ### Organization

I believe that I touched up on the skill of organization because of the way I planned out my learning process. Although I lost the paper that I sketched for how I want my demo website to look like, I did a pretty good job working on this skill. To ensure that my learning process would flow as smoothly as possible, I had to make sure that everything was going on track. Another example of me practicing this skill would be when I created my Personality Quiz plan. I planned ahead on what I wanted to do with the tool that I chose. This skill would help me in other instances in terms of smoothly getting things done without confusion.



 ### Decision Making

During the research I conducted in order to chose a topic, I made a decision that I am proud of. I'm glad that I chose to make a Personality Quiz because of the many positive implications that can be the outcome of this project. I had to logically think about which topic would have a greater positve effect and went along with it. If I continue to use this logic every day or for future projects, I will be able to pick what is good for me.



## Next Steps
I am prepared to start my research/tinkering on the Easy Toggle State tool.
