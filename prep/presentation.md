# Presentation Plan

## Hook
* Ask: “Have you ever wondered what your true personality type is?”
* Set the mood: “Well, I made a quiz to help you find out!”
  

## Product
* Why I wanted to create a Personality Quiz (What was my goal/achievement?) 
* Show the live website and demo the quiz ( maybe answer as a class?)


## Process
* Built the quiz using HTML, CSS, Wow.js, and Easy Toggle State
* Code snippets of using Easy Toggle State tool and explain it 
* Talk about the array of questions and how each one adds points toward a personality (functionality of the quiz)
* An issue that occured during the making ( maybe how the answer choices were not accurate because of the amount of questions?) 


## Conclusion
* Elaborate on what I did to solve the issue
* Takeaways --> skills that I got 
* Yellkey to project
* Final ending slide 

<!-- EXAMPLE

## Hook
* Verbal riddle of GGD

## Product
* GIF/Demo of example/non-example

## Process
* Flowchart of plan
  * MVP: noun -> door -> yes/no
  * Beyond MVP: noun -> word relation API -> noun API -> yes/no, with counterexample
* Code snippets of:
  * MVP
  * Both APIs
  * Challenge with API keys

## Conclusion
* [URL to project]
* Takeaways
  * Less = more: the heart of the riddle was one line of code; it obviously took more to make the entire thing work, but one complicated line of regular expressions was essentially the solution to the riddle
  * Expect the unexpected: it’s important to budget time for things you don’t account for; for example, I didn’t consider the fact that I would need another entire API to detect nouns
  * Determination is key: ironically enough, I had to make my API keys private. At first, it didn’t seem like it was possible, which meant I couldn’t publish my app. But after all of that hard work, I was determined to find a solution, and I found it in config variables.
* "Presentation can’t, but a speech can"
