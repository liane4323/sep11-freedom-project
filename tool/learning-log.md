* First thing that I did was search up "Easy Toggle State for beginners" on Youtube, I only found tutorials on how to make toggles from scratch.
 * Instead of watching tutorials, I wanted to explore the <a href = "https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/" > Easy Toggle State </a> website.
* When exploring the website of my tool, I took a look at the demo page. _The demo page is a website that developers made in order to show us how the concepts of this tool work._
* Link to the demo page website: https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/demo
  * On the demo page I tried to visualize how I want to layout my quiz. The developers that created the demo page used features like **Tabs and Checkboxes**
  * Later on, I officially came up with 1 feature that I will be using in my website. The feature is called **"Radio buttons"**.

* I chose this feature because it looks like an answer choice section from a quiz. It reminded me of google forms that I would fill out in school. You can see the resemblance in the picture above.


Here 3 phrases that I have learnt + their meanings in my own words:

* **recurrent behavior** - atterns or actions that repeat over time (mostly through functions).
* **native component** - a UI element for the use of better performance on many devices.
* **ARIA** - make web applications more accessible like screen readers (_Accessible Rich Internet Applications_).


**Next up:** I will pick another feature that is suitible for my freedom project.
