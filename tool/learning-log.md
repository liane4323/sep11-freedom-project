### 9/30/24:
* I tried searching up "Easy Toggle State for beginners" on Youtube and I only found tutorials on how to make toggles from scratch.
 * Instead of watching tutorials, I wanted to explore the <a href = "https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/" > Easy Toggle State </a> website.
* When exploring the webiste of my tool, I took a look at the demo page. _The demo page is a website that developers made in order to show us how the concepts of this tool work._
* Link of the website: https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/demo 
  * On the demo page I tried to visualize on how I want to layout my quiz. The developers that created the demo page used features like **Tabs and Checkboxes**  
  * Later on, I officialy came up with 1 feature that I will be using in my website. The feature is called **"Radio buttons"**. I chose this feature because it looks like a answer choice section from a quiz. As you can see in the picture below:

* **Next I will try to pick another feature that I can use in my website**
