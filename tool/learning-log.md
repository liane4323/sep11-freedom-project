### 9/30/24:
* I tried searching up "Easy Toggle State for beginners" on Youtube and I only found tutorials on how to make toggles from scratch.
* Instead of watching tutorials, I wanted to explore the <a href = "https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/" > Easy Toggle State </a> website.
* When exploring the webiste, I took a look at the demo page. _The demo page is a website that developers made in order to show us how the concepts of this tool work. _
* Link of the website: https://twikito.github.io/easy-toggle-state/demo 
  * On the demo page I tried to visualize on how I want to layout my quiz. I took note on the way the developers used this tool.
  * While doing researching about this tool, I came up with 2 concepts that I will be using in my website.
